<p>I have purposely delayed writing to you for some little time, until the last and most sacred ceremony had past.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> Your note was most affecting to read—such tender love and so soon separated.— What a comfort it must be to you,—that is I think I should find it the greatest—the having children—<ref target="#foot.f2"/> it must make the separation appear less entire—the unspeakable tenderness of young children must soothe the heart &amp; recall the tenderest however mournful remembrances—</p>
<p>My dear old friend, I do not know why I write, for I can offer only sympathy, &amp; I can well imagine what small comfort that must be— I trust your bodily health has withstood your trial pretty well. You must have a good deal of occupation at present, which I should think would be your best relief— My health has been as usual oscillating up &amp; down, but I certainly gain strength though at a very slow pace.— my two dear little children are very well and very fat. Emma however is uncomfortable enough all day long &amp; seldom leaves the house,—this being her usual state before her babies come into the world— I trust time &amp; your own innate powers of cheerful endurance will eventually make your future prospects appear brighter than can now seem possible—</p>
<p>Farewell.— Let me hear from you again | My dear Fox farewell | Charles Darwin</p>
