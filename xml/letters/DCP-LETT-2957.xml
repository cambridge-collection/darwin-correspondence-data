                    <p>I thank you sincerely for your kind note &amp; very curious little fact about the Ducks.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> I much hope that you will attend a little more to them. Is the breed in any way different externally from the other ducks of Ceylon which do frequent water? Has any body else observed the same facts with these Ducks? Is there any danger in the waters to which the Ducks are exposed? How curious it would be if you were to get some eggs from the aquatic breed of some other district &amp; compare their habits with your own ducks. It really is worth a little trouble.— I have seen ducks in England dabbling in long grass.—</p>
                    <p>Your sentence about my views more commending themselves to your mind, has pleased me <hi rend="underline">extremely</hi>.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> I care much for the opinion of naturalists &amp; very little for that of the public.— The avalanche of Reviews against me has hardly yet ceased; but they have hurt me very little; &amp; I hear from Murray that my Book goes on selling well.— It will be a long battle, before it is known how much truth &amp; how much error there is in my Book. But I find that all those who went at first an inch with me go a foot or so now.— I know of no renegades as yet.— I have no news for I have not seen a naturalist for several months.</p>
                    <p>With every good wish &amp; thanks | Pray believe me | Yours very sincerely | Charles Darwin</p>
