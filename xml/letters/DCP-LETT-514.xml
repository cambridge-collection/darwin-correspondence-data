<p>I have known Syms Covington for more than eight years, during the whole of that period, his conduct has been perfectly satisfactory. He accompanied me as servant in the voyage of H.M.S. Beagle, round the world, and made himself generally useful. He assisted me then as clerk, and this has been his chief employment since that voyage.— He writes an excellent hand, and understands something of accounts.— In circumstances of difficulty he has always behaved with prudence.— In the management of my affairs (and of his own) he has invariably acted with economy. I have never once seen him in the least degree affected by any spirituous liquor.— I have constantly been in the habit of trusting him both with large and small sums of money, and have good reason to believe he is trust worthy in the <hi rend="underline">highest</hi> degree. The misfortune of a slight deafness is the sole draw back to his advancement in life</p>
