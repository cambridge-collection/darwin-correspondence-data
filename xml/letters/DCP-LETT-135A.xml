<p>Thanks CTW for his letter [<hi rend="doubleUnderline">125</hi>]. "I do not think I ever received a more kind letter than yours or one that gave me so much pleasure.— You ought to have in your mind, the prospect of leaving England for 3 or 4 years before you can understand how to enjoy such a letter from such a person as yourself—". Regarding the voyage, "all is finally settled, &amp; I have sealed away about half a chance of life.— If one lived merely to see how long one could spin out life,—I should repent my choice.— As it is I do not.—"</p> 
            <p>Thanks CTW for four fungi which have arrived.</p>

<p>I found your letter on my table, when I came from Plymouth; but I really I had not time to write to you from London or Cambridge, in neither of which places did I stay more than 2 days.— I saw Herbert at Cam. &amp; am afraid this letter will not reach you.— I shall be very sorry for it, for I do not think I ever received a more kind letter than yours or one that gave me so much pleasure.— You ought to have in your mind, the prospect of leaving England for 3 or 4 years before you can understand how to enjoy such a letter from such a person as yourself.— I am afraid we shall not meet, I leave Shrewsbury this day week.— Herbert will find out from Henslow my direction, times of writing &amp;c. &amp; when I can (it must necessarily be very seldom) you shall hear of and from me.— I am rather tired this morning, &amp; the post is soon going out; so that you will excuse this letter: I have nothing particular to say excepting that all is finally settled, &amp; I have sealed away about half a chance of life.— If one lived merely to see how long one could spin out life.— I should repent of my choice.— As it is I do not.—</p>
<p>Again I thank you, my dear Whitley, for all your kind wishes, I hope they will come true, &amp; that when I return, I shall find you a happy &amp; useful man.</p>
<p>God bless you | My dear Whitley | Your affectionate friend | Chas. Darwin.—</p>
<p>Some Fungi have arrived much obliged for them.—</p>
