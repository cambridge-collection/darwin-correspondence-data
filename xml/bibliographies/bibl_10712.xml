Part II (1881): The origin of the markings of caterpillars. On phyletic parallelism in metamorphic species. Part III (1882): The transformation of the Mexican axolotl into amblystoma.

    <idno>MA.14.85 NC.  For publication details of the parts see front and endpapers bound at back. [NB it is eccentric to use part publication details (which are rarely available) rather than title/imprint page (which has 1882) but I don't see the point in arguing. Use this rather than Weismann 1882 in future. SE.]</idno>
