        <p>German educator and writer on animal psychology. Studied philosophy and pedagogy at Leipzig and Jena; attended Ernst Haeckel’s lectures at Jena, from around 1869. Worked at the German school in Naples, where he built a small aquarium to pursue his research on animal psychology, 1878–80. Was refused a place at the Zoological Station at Naples, partly due to lack of qualifications, but also because of his conflict with Anton Dohrn, the director. Emigrated to Chile in 1889; founder and first director of the German School in Santiago, 1891. Co-founder and first director of the Instituto Pedagógico, a teacher-training college, 1892. </p></note>
