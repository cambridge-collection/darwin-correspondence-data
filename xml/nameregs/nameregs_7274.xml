        <p>Poet and literary scholar. Worked in his father’s Gloucestershire wine business, and published poems in the ‘Spasmodic’ school, which was criticised for excess of metaphor and extravagance of language. Delivered a three-hour lecture ‘The nature of poetry’ to the Edinburgh Philosophical Society in 1857. His poems reflected his deep religious convictions. A supporter of rights for women and the co-operative system of private enterprise.</p></note>
