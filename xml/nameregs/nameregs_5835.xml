        <p>Controversialist. Son of a Dorset clergyman. Matriculated at St Mary Hall, Oxford, 1839, but left without a degree. Author of works on cosmology and military subjects. Famous for his offer of £500 to anyone who could prove the earth was round, and for his subsequent refusal to accept A. R. Wallace’s experimental proof.</p></note>
