Worked in his father’s wine business, eventually setting up a private laboratory in Breslau in 1866. Stepped down as head of the business in 1886 and moved to Berlin in 1891. Worked on the oxidation process in animals and plants. Discovered that alcoholic fermentation was caused by a non-living enzyme.
