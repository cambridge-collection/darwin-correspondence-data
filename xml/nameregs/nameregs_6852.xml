        <p>Eldest son of Ethiopian King Tewodros II and Tawabach. Considered heir to throne when his father died in 1868. Placed under guardianship of Tristram Charles Sawyer Speedy. Moved to Oudh, India with Speedy. When Speedy moved to Penang in 1871, the British government ordered that Alämayyähu be returned to England, where he was educated at Cheltenham College, Rugby School, and the military academy at Sandhurst. By 1879 plans to replace existing Ethiopian king with Prince Alämayyähu had receded due to deteriorating relations between Ethiopia and Britain.</p></note>
